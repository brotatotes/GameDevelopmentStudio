# Lua  
In Lua, Player 1 uses the keyboard to control Lua, a platforming character in a dangerous and chaotic world ruled by Player 2, who uses the mouse to place, drop, and spawn entities to try to stop her from reaching the end of each level. Detailed control instructions are shown at the beginning of each level!  
  
Lua was developed during Northwestern University's [EECS 395 Game Development Studio](http://robert.zubek.net/docs/games-studio-2017/) taught by Robert Zubek.
